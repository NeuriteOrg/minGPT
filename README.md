![mingpt](mingpt.jpg)

Modified [Andrej's](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) and [William's](https://github.com/williamFalcon/minGPT) awesome code to provide a benchmark script and show how to train a model from scratch at scale using Lightning.

Currently implements Sharded and DeepSpeed training on two branches, with benchmarks for both individually.

- [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/SeanNaren/minGPT/tree/stage3)
- [Fully Sharded](https://github.com/SeanNaren/minGPT/tree/fully_sharded)
